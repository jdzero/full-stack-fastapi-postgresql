- Some settings are best deferred if just trying to get system running locally... email, etc.
- Need update to python container, pip, etc.
- Running up through bootstrapping and direction to docker-compose up is good... need more of an intro to "what" is set up for you.
- Refactor backend and worker to inherit from same base.
- NPM out of date
- Added .devcontainer.json to each of frontend and backend
- Added missiong volumes in override for bind mounting files...
- F1 => Remote-Containers: Open Folder in Container..
- Misused .env to unconditionally load env vars rather than setting on compose file
- Flower, pgadmin are not prod services
- First time setup all baked in to containers... maybe for dev only?  Use out of band scripts for deployments?
